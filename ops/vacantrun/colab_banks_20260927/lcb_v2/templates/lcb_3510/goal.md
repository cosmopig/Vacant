You are given an array maximumHeight, where maximumHeight[i] denotes the maximum height the i^th tower can be assigned.
Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:

The height of the i^th tower is a positive integer and does not exceed maximumHeight[i].
No two towers have the same height.

Return the maximum possible total sum of the tower heights. If it's not possible to assign heights, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: maximumHeight = [2,3,4,3]
Output: 10
Explanation:
We can assign heights in the following way: [1, 2, 4, 3].

Example 2:

Input: maximumHeight = [15,10]
Output: 25
Explanation:
We can assign heights in the following way: [15, 10].

Example 3:

Input: maximumHeight = [2,2,1]
Output: -1
Explanation:
It's impossible to assign positive heights to each index so that no two towers have the same height.

 
Constraints:

1 <= maximumHeight.length <= 10^5
1 <= maximumHeight[i] <= 10^9

請寫一個頂層 Python 函式（不要用 class）：
def maximumTotalSum(maximumHeight: List[int]):
