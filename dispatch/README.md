# Dispatch — cloud Claude Code prompts

Each `P*_*.md` is a self-contained prompt for one cloud Claude Code session. Each session:

1. clones https://github.com/cosmopig/Vacant
2. reads `/CLAUDE.md` and the prompt's "Read first" list
3. branches `feat/P#-<slug>` off `main`
4. implements per the prompt
5. opens a PR titled per the prompt's "Output" line

You merge sequentially / in parallel per the DAG below.

## Dependency DAG

```
P0 ── P1 ──┐
   ├── P2 ──┴── P5 ──┐
   │       ├── P4 ───┤
   │       │   ├── P3 ┤
   │       │   └── P6 ┤
   │                  └── P7
```

| Stage | Prompt | Depends on | Can parallel with | Weeks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `P0_bootstrap.md` | — | — | 1 |
| 1 | `P1_runtime.md` | P0 | P2 | 2 |
| 1 | `P2_identity.md` | P0 | P1 | 2 |
| 2 | `P4_registry.md` | P2 | — | 2 |
| 3 | `P3_reputation.md` | P4, P1 | P6 | 2 |
| 3 | `P6_protocol.md` | P4, P2, P1 | P3 | 2 |
| 4 | `P5_composite.md` | P1, P2, P4 | — | 2 |
| 5 | `P7_mvp.md` | all above | — | 4 (= W11-14) |

## How to dispatch

For each stage, copy the prompt content into a new cloud Claude Code session pointed at this repo. Do not paraphrase. Each prompt assumes its predecessor's PR is merged unless explicitly told otherwise.

After every merge, pull locally and verify:

```bash
git pull
uv sync
uv run pytest --cov=vacant --cov-report=term-missing
uv run mypy src/
```

If anything regresses, do not start the next stage — fix on the merged branch first.

## Branch protection

Recommended on `main`:
- Require PR review (you = reviewer)
- Require CI green
- Require linear history
- Disallow force push

## When to escalate to you

Cloud Claude Code should open a "blocked" PR and ping you when:
- A spec is genuinely ambiguous (not just unclear — actually contradictory)
- A theory invariant from CLAUDE.md "Load-bearing decisions" appears to need changing
- An external dependency's API has changed since the spec was written
- Test failures persist after 2 attempts at fixing
